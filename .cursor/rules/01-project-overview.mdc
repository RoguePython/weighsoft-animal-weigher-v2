# WeighsoftAnimalWeigherV2 - Project Rules

## Project Overview
This is a React Native application for animal weighing functionality.
Follow all rules defined in this `.cursor/rules` directory.

## Golden Rules
1. **ALWAYS start with todo.md** when doing large tasks
2. **Document as you go** to avoid hallucinations
3. **Test everything** - unit tests and E2E tests with Playwright
4. **Verify APK builds** frequently - don't go too far without confirming builds work
5. **Version, commit, build, test** after significant changes
